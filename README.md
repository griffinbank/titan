# Titan

Titan is a simple and extensible framework for building Clojure web applications.
Whether you're new to Clojure or an experienced Clojurist, Titan can help you
develop quickly and with delight.

You might be thinking what is Clojure? 

Clojure is a modern, dynamic, and functional dialect of the Lisp programming language on the Java platform.
Clojure advocates immutability and immutable data structures and encourages programmers to be explicit about managing identity and its states.
Clojure made #6 for the Most Loved Language and made #1 for top paying Globally, and #2 for top paying in the US. Clojure is based on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). If you are part of tribe JVM, then is worth considering as an alternative to Scala or Java.

*Titan is guided by the following core principles:*

 - Simple is better than complex
 - Clarity is better than cleverness
 - Build for extension: everything should compose.

## Getting Started

If you're getting started from scratch, you can quickly create a new Titan
project by using the Titan Leiningen template

```
lein new titan-app YOUR_APP_NAME
```

If you're looking to configure an existing application with Titan, we recommend
